## Licensing

1337x-wtf is a fork of notflix featuring actual
comprehensible shell code written by myself.

Since the original project is under a GPL license
I'm legally oblied to honor it and keep it like that.

## Progress

Currently I'm working on rewriting `push-subs` to achive some more flexibility.
